# LifeCal

(Currently in progress)

This is a interactive web app based on the Life Calendar proposed on the [Wait But Why blog](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html) which aims to provide a straightforward and efficient interface to store and track progress on the scale of a lifetime, including adding labels/tags, notes, etc.
